I started this game as a remembering the my old Unity knowledge.(title:"remembering_the_things")
But then I found myself making a 2D platform action game.
Short story: I had joined a game development summer camp via online: DIGIAGE Gme Dvelopment Summer Camp.(09.01.2022 - 09.10.2022)
It would last in 10 days. Anyone who have some prequisite could join online or directly. 
But online side was not so efficient due to some negligence. In camp we could join any team and help/support them for their projects in some areas like art, coding, design etc. I was wanting make Unity coding and improve myself on this topic. Becasuse I had done before at beginner level. I am accepted a team at first. In order to "remembering_the_things" (things: my old Unity knowledge) I created this project. I was working basic Unity things and Unity coding library. I worked first on 2D Physics and movement. But then due to some online negligences and I didn't take any answer later.
So I decided to make something to improve my self and I would post what I make to camp's Discord server for ask some criticism and comment.
And I began make 2D platform action, because I love this genre so much. As a result:

# What I learned or do first time in this project:
* 2D Physics:
   - Rigidbody
   - Raycasting
   - Colliders
   - Collider methods (OnEnterColliding, OnStayColliding, OnTriggerEnter/Exit etc.)
* Using animator for 2D
* Making animation with premade character animation frames.
* Level designing with Tilemap Editor.
* Coding basic enemy AI.
* Basic player camera control.
* Player control things(movement, attack etc.).
* Coroutines
* Particle System
* Resolution problem.

I began to remembering something, but it turned into a protoype like tihng. I posted at 8th day. And I took several criticism.
They were constructive. Then I changed and added somethings and I posted it again. Someone said this project can be continue. That was happy for me.
Last downloadable version took 12-15 days(70-90 hour approximately) to do. I don't decide I'm gonna keep work on this project or not, because of financial issues. :) Time is gonna show that.

!!!ATTENTION!!!:
* Visual assests imported from free sources. I didn't do any visual asset. 
Just used animator and Unity animation tool to make character animations from premade assets.
And used Premade Tilemap to make basic level design.
* Some comment lines not English because of this was just personal project/exercise.
